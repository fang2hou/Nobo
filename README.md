# Nobo
The project is stopped since the Javascript code inside page has been confused,  :(   
It seems Ritsumeikan University started to use f5 obfuscator. So maybe you can also use Nobo to build your unique back-end apps.  

Even if you are a student of Ritsumeikan University, don't worry about that.  
The solution now I found is using selenium to rebuild Nobo as a human-like spider.  
Nobo-ng(Nobo next generation) will be updated in dev branch until it works perfectly.

Thanks for your concern. 

Fang.
