# Nobo
The project is stopped since the Javascript code inside page has been confused,  :(   
It seems only Ritsumeikan University deployed f5 obfuscator. So maybe you can also use Nobo to build your unique back-end apps.  

Even if you are a student of Ritsumeikan University, don't worry about that.  
The solution now I found is using selenium to rebuild Nobo as a human-like spider.  
You could keep track of progress in `dev` branch anytime.  
Nobo-ng(Nobo next generation) will be updated in  until it works perfectly.  

Thanks for your concern.
